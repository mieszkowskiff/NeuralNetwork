# This is the implementation of multilayer perceptron from scratch

This project is a part of 2024/2025 winter semester course in Neural Networks at Warsaw University of Technology, faculty of Mathematics and information Sciences.
The main aim of this project is to implement a multi-layer perceptron from scratch.
The main part of this projects is in the ```neural_network.py``` file,
where the neural net is implemented together with backpropagation.
Fill free to experiment with this neural network.
